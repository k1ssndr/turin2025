From the 15th to 19th of September, 2025, we are organising a summer school followed by a workshop on the vibrant topic of "Process Metaphysics". Our event is generously hosted by the University of Turin thanks to Prof. Gabriele Gava. We thereby continue our tradition of international, philosophical events on the nature of time and dynamicity during the summer days in northern Italy combining warm weather with cool debates. (see our previous event: https://s-p-o-t.weebly.com/time-continuum.html)

On the following pages you can find information both on the summer school organised for international students and the following workshop featuring distinguished researchers.
